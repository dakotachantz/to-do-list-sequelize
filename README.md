# Build a todo list

Using Express and Sequelize, build a real todo list application.

Use Express to build a todo list application. In order to keep the list of todos, create a database using Sequelize and update it from Express. 

You should be able to add new todos and mark todos as complete. You should add the ability to edit and delete individual todos. Your application might look like this mockup.
